              "description": "Piers Morgan says he believes the news of King Charles' cancer diagnosis has come as shock to everyone, including the Royal Family.\n\nThe type of cancer has not been disclosed, but it was discovered during the King's recent treatment for an enlarged prostate.\n\nThe King informed close family members, including his sons Prince William and Prince Harry, as well as his three siblings. Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has already spoken to his father over the phone and is said to be flying into the UK in the coming days to see him. The public announcement was made at 6pm, leaving the world in shock and uncertainty.\n\nAlthough the exact details of the diagnosis have not been revealed, it is clear that this is a serious situation. The King began regular treatments as an outpatient, following his recent procedure for an enlarged prostate. He will continue to undertake basic state duties from the Palace, such as his weekly meeting with the Prime Minister. However, all public engagements have been postponed for the duration of his treatment. It remains uncertain whether he will be able to fulfil major international trips planned for the coming months.\n\nPiers Morgan is joined by TalkTV's Royal Editor Sarah Hewson, Royal biographer Tom Bower, broadcaster Andrew Neil, and Roya Nikkah, Royal Editor of The Sunday Times.\n\nSubscribe to stay up-to-date on all Uncensored content.\n\nFollow Piers Morgan Uncensored on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PiersUncensored\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorganuncensored/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/piersmorganuncensored\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@piersmorganuncensored\n\nFollow Piers Morgan on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/piersmorgan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorgan\n\nPiers Morgan Uncensored is now available on TalkTV, Fox Nation and Sky News Australia!\n\n#kingcharles #piersmorgan #royalfamily #interview #piersmorganuncensored",
